This project is a backend application built with [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Features

- **Fast Development**: Leverages Vite for a fast development experience.
- **Modern Backend Framework**: Uses Hono, a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for the Edge.
- **Environment Configuration**: Supports environment variable configuration using `.env` files via the `dotenv` package.
- **Logging**: Integrated with `pino` for efficient JSON logging, likely using `hono-pino` middleware.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version specified in `package.json` if applicable, or latest LTS)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd onedrive-hook-update
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install
    ```

3.  Set up your environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your necessary environment variables.
    Example:
    ```env
    PORT=3000
    ANOTHER_VARIABLE=your_value
    ```
    _(Note: While Hono might listen on a specific port if configured, when running with `vite` for development, it typically serves through Vite's port.)_

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
# or
# pnpm dev
```

The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`. Vite's dev server will proxy requests to your Hono application.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
# yarn build
# or
# pnpm build
```

This will create a production-ready build in the `dist` directory. You can then deploy the contents of this directory or use a Node.js server (like `@hono/node-server`, which is in your dependencies) to serve the application.

### Running the Production Build

After building the project, you can run the server using:

```bash
node ./dist/index.cjs
```

Make sure you have configured any necessary environment variables for your production environment.
